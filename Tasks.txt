For this project I have decided to create a price logger for smartphones' price. 
Recently, I tried to resell my phone to get an new one. I was shocked to see the value depreciation after 3 years.
Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to create a price logger to see the change in price of an smartphone after the release.
For this first version, the inputs will be hard coded. However, i hope to implement some web scrapping to add the logs automatically.


For the database I will create three tables that will be related:

Brand table ( contains all the brands available) --> one to many --> Phone table ( contains all the phone models available ) ---> one to many --> price log table (change in prices for each phone model)

BackEnd TasK:

- Brands


- Models


- Prices


BackEnd APIs:

    - GET brands
    - Create Brand

    - UPDATE phone (:id phone)
    - DELETE phone (:id phone)
    - POST phone

    - GET Single Price or phone (:id price)
